## Api

### `encodeStudent`
Given a student object, returns a URL-formatted stringified version of it.

### `filterAreaList`
> If there's only one Physics major, then anyone can see and choose it. Otherwise, if there are more than one, then the list gets culled.

> The newest revision of a major is always available, unless the `available through` key is set.

> You can only enroll in a major if there isn't a newer one, unless your class year is between the previous one and the newest.

Given a list of area objects and a graduation year, filters the list to only those areas that can be used by the graduation year.
